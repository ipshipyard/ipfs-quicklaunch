# Browser Extension Plan: IPFS App Launcher with Petnames

## Overview
A browser extension that serves as an IPFS app launcher with petname support, featuring an elegant modern flag UI for bookmarking apps with custom names and URLs, including support for multiple versions per app.

## Core Features & Requirements

### Primary Features
- **App Bookmarking**: Save apps with custom petnames and URLs
- **Version Management**: Multiple versions per app with unique URLs and hashes
- **Modern Flag UI**: Clean, elegant interface with visual app representations
- **Local Storage**: All data stored locally for privacy and speed
- **Quick Launch**: One-click app launching from browser

### User Experience
- Intuitive bookmark creation and editing
- Visual app icons/flags for easy recognition
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Drag-and-drop organization
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

## Technical Architecture & Data Model

### Extension Structure
- **Manifest V3** compatibility
- **Popup UI** as primary interface
- **Background Service Worker** for data management
- **Content Scripts** for webpage integration (if needed)

### Data Model
```typescript
interface App {
  id: string;
  petname: string;
  description?: string;
  icon?: string;
  versions: AppVersion[];
  tags: string[];
  createdAt: Date;
  lastUsed: Date;
}

interface AppVersion {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  url: string;
  hash?: string;
  isDefault: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

### Storage Strategy
- Chrome Storage API for persistence
- Local caching for performance
- Export/import functionality for backup

## UI/UX Design & Components

### Visual Design
- **Modern Flag Theme**: Each app represented as a stylized flag
- **Grid/List Views**: Toggle between visual and compact layouts
- **Dark/Light Themes**: User preference support
- **Responsive Design**: Adapt to different popup sizes

### Component Structure
- `AppGrid`: Main container for app flags
- `AppFlag`: Individual app representation
- `AppEditor`: Modal for creating/editing apps
- `VersionManager`: Interface for managing app versions
- `SearchBar`: Filter and search functionality
- `SettingsPanel`: Configuration options

### Interaction Patterns
- Click to launch default version
- Right-click context menu for version selection
- Hover for quick app info
- Drag handles for reordering

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Extension manifest and basic structure
- Data models and storage layer
- Basic popup UI framework
- Simple app creation and storage

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 3-4)
- App flag UI components
- Version management system
- Launch functionality
- Search and filtering

### Phase 3: Polish & Enhancement (Week 5-6)
- Visual theming and animations
- Export/import functionality
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Settings and preferences

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 7-8)
- Icon extraction from websites
- Hash verification for versions
- Usage analytics and recommendations
- Performance optimizations

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Key Challenges
1. **Cross-Origin Access**: Limited ability to fetch app metadata
   - *Solution*: Use Chrome extension permissions, fallback to user input
2. **Storage Limitations**: Chrome storage quotas
   - *Solution*: Efficient data compression, optional cloud sync
3. **Version Hash Validation**: Ensuring app integrity
   - *Solution*: Background worker for periodic hash checks
4. **Performance**: Fast loading with many bookmarks
   - *Solution*: Virtual scrolling, lazy loading, indexed search

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React/Vue.js with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or styled-components
- **Build Tool**: Vite or Webpack
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Create initial project structure
3. Implement Phase 1 features
4. Iterative development and testing
